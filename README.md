[![Part of RV Tool Chest](https://img.shields.io/badge/RV%20Tool%20Chest-Ecosystem-blue)](https://example.com/rvtoolchest) <!-- Replace with actual link -->

A comprehensive dashboard for aggregating, visualizing, and analyzing alternative asset investments.

## Purpose

Alternative Asset Explorer aims to provide investors with a clear, unified view of their holdings in non-traditional asset classes such as real estate, collectibles, commodities, private equity, and more. Traditional investment platforms often lack robust support for these assets. This tool aggregates data (either manually entered or via potential future integrations) and offers visualization and analysis features specifically tailored for the unique characteristics of alternative investments.

It serves as a central hub within the **RV Tool Chest** ecosystem for understanding the performance, risk, and diversification impact of alternative assets within a broader portfolio context.

*   **Comparison Charts**: Visualizes historical returns and performance trends for selected assets or categories, enabling side-by-side comparisons.
*   **Basic Metrics**: Calculates and displays essential metrics relevant to alternative assets, including:
    *   Volatility
    *   Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
    *   Correlation to traditional equities (e.g., S&P 500)
